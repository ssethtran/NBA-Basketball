# NBA-Basketball
CS 1D Project 2 NBA Basketball

## Requirments

These are a series of modules/tools required for the project to properly run. 

- C++ 17
- CMake
- SQL 
- SQLite
- Qt 6

### Recommendation

The following platforms are suggestions to facilitate working with program and coding in general. These are not required for the project to build/compile, but to simply improve visualization of data structure, tracking work flow, or/and help with systematic coding. 

- [Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip)
- [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/ "Git Kraken")
- [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6)

Clion is the recommended IDE for coding any c++ related projects. Since CMake is used as the c++ packet manager, CLion provides different tools that can be used to improve coding along with Cmake CLI. DataGrip is used for SQL codes. The IDE enables programmers to concurrently use multiple different data management systems, such as Oracle RDBMS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and etc. in a templated project. Git Karaken enables programers to visualize git tracking, commits, and branches.
